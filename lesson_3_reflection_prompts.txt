When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you're working from multiple computers or when multiple people are working on one repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If you're collaborating with other people, you might not want to save large branches until they're finalized. Or you might want to experiment with changes in the remote and then pull them to the local machine of your choice when they're ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a clone of a repo in github, made using github, which logs where it was forked from (and shows the original repo owner that it was forked). You would use a fork when you want to modify/build on someone else's project that you don't have permission to edit. You create your own version, but github makes it easy to send push requests to the owner if you want to ask them to incorporate your changes. A clone is a copy, can be local to local, remote to local, or remote to remote. A branch is within one repo. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
